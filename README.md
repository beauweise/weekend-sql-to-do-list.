Description
<!-- Duration: 2 1/2 Day Sprint -->

<!-- I had Friday evening, Saturday and Sunday to complete this project. During this project the errors that I ran into were mostly generated by myself. Small spelling errors and syntax errors were my main problems. I had my server up and running and linking my client files to the server, and database took a little longer than expected. I am ever improving my CSS skills, but those seemed to give me some troubles as well. My improvements for next time will be to give myself a better framework when starting. -->
